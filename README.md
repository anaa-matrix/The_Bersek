The rapid growth of e-commerce has revolutionized shopping, yet challenges persist in the online fashion
experience. Users frequently face difficulty in accurately visualizing how clothing items will fit and
look on themselves when browsing online catalogs, leading to purchase hesitation and high return rates.
This uncertainty impacts satisfaction and conversion rates.

Secondly, 
the absence of social interaction and collaborative features within these platforms
diminishes the interactive and communal aspects that are traditionally enjoyed in physical retail settings.
Users lack opportunities to seek feedback from friends or share their fashion choices,which reduces
their engagement levels and the time they spend on the platform.

Enhancing the online shopping experience involves integrating advanced technologies like virtual
try-on features and collaborative wardrobe platforms. These solutions aim to improve user
confidence in purchasing decisions and create a more immersive, socially engaging environment.
This approach encourages longer session times and fosters increased platform loyalty
